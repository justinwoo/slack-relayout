# Slack Relayout

Slack default layout doesn't let you have small width windows (hardcoded min-width) and puts the channels list on the left. This fixes those.

However, you will see a flash of content on load due to the hardcoded layout. Whatever.

## Installation

Open <chrome://extensions/> and drag `slack-relayout.user.js` in.
